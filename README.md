# GBxHAT

**A GBxCart RW in PiZero Hat format**

Uses the original schematic by [InsideGadgets](https://github.com/insidegadgets/GBxCart-RW) with some changes

Uses the Pi Zero HAT template by [Mike Lawrence](https://github.com/mikelawrence/RPi_Zero_pHat_Template)


The CH340 was removed, as TX and RX are connected straight to the pi zero

**Keep in mind that this is untested and has no software**
